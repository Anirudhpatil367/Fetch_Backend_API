1.Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
In my earlier professiona as a full stack developer, I was familiar in creating backend components using Java. While pursuing my masters, I observed that a major role of enterprise-level backend systems that continue to depend on Java. With the  contrast of Spring Boot, the process of creating APIs that became both straightforward and efficient.

on the other way, my aim is to to construct a REST API that is not only scalable but easy to maintain, by following best practise and maintaining company standards. To fulfill this, I used a robost development stack consisting Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and Maven. The combination of all these proved a highly responsive in meeting the project requirements.
